        <h1>HOLI</h1>
        <p>Holi is an ancient Hindu tradition and also one of the most popular festivals in Hinduism.</p>
        <p>It celebrates the eternal and divine love of Radha Krishna.The day also signifies the triumph of good over evil,
            as it commemorates the victory <br> of Lord Vishnu as Narasimha Narayana over Hiranyakashipu.</p>
        <p>Holi celebrations are also known as the Festival of Colours, the Festival of Spring, and the Festival of Love.</p>
        <p>Holi celebrations start on the night before Holi with a Holika Dahan where people gather, perform religious rituals in front of a bonfire,<br>
            and pray that their internal evil be destroyed the way Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, was killed in the fire.</p>
        <p>The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi (Dhuleti) where people smear and drench each other with colours.</p>
        <p>Holi celebrates the arrival of spring, the end of winter, the blossoming of love and for many,
            it is a festive day to meet others, play and laugh,<br> forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships.</p>
