    <h1>DIWALI</h1>
    <br>
    <p>1)Diwali is an important religious festival originating in India. People often think of Diwali as a Hindu festival,
        but it is also celebrated by Sikhs and Jains.</p>
    <p>2) Diwali takes place annually and lasts for five days, marking the start of the Hindu New Year. 
        The exact dates change each year<br> and are determined by the position of the moon – but it usually falls between October and November.</p>
    <p>3)The word Diwali (or Deepavali as it’s sometimes called) means “row of lights” in an Ancient language of India, called Sanskrit.<br>
         During this festival, people decorate their homes with lights and oil lamps, called diyas.</p>
    <p>4)For many people, Diwali honours the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi. 
          The lights and lamps are said to help Lakshmi <br>find her way into peoples’ homes, bringing prosperity in the year to come!</p>
    <p>5)It’s also a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and different legends based on this theme are associated with Diwali. <br>In northern India,
        Hindus celebrate the return of the deities (gods) Rama and Sita to the city of Ayodhya,<br> after defeating the evil king Ravana!</p>
